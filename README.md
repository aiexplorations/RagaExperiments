# Raga Experiments
Carnatic music is an ancient art form from southern India, and like its northern Indian counterpart, is a systematic combination of melodic and rhythmical patterns. This repository contains code written in Scala for demonstrating the Carnatic ragas, or scales. 

Raga Experiments is developed and maintained by Rajesh RS ( http://rexplorations.wordpress.com / https://twitter.com/rexplorations / https://linkedin.com/in/rajeshrs ). Meera Sundar ( http://twitter.com/msundr ), a Carnatic music violinist is a contributor of ideas to this too. And hopefully she'll submit code too, someday!

## Why Scala?

Scala is uniquely capable of modeling some of the problems involving sequences and patterns. Although much of the current code base is object oriented in nature and makes limited use of closures, significant improvements can be made to the code base by adopting a functional style for generating patterns, which I hope to incorporate in coming versions of the code base.

Of course, there are other languages out there like Python that are eminently suited for building such an application. 

## What is Carnatic music?

Carnatic is the classical music of South India - it not only has a rich history spanning centuries (some say even millennia), but it is full of the vibrancy and beauty you expect in a contemporary art form. Numerous well known performers and composers are in vogue to this day, and there are huge festivals in the southern Indian cities of Chennai, Bangalore and Trivandrum that are dedicated to this art form.

More about Carnatic music can be found on the following sites:

* http:///www.karnatik.com ( a great site for beginners and aficionados with details of ragas and compositions )
* http://www.carnatic.com/ ( a good source of general information on Carnatic music )
* http://rasikas.org ( Carnatic music online forums )
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music

Three great composers in the Carnatic music tradition are all considered saints in regional scholarly and musical traditions.

## Broader objectives and ideas

The objective of this set of experiments is to:

# Model a raga as a sequence of swaras with an easy interface (Arrays of strings as input to the ragas)
# Generate a sequence of swaras based on the definition of a particular raga
# Play this sequence of swaras using the JavaFX Midi interface

Further to this, I am interested in experimenting with a functional style of programming in Scala to generate some of the raga alapanas and sequences. More in the code!
